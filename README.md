The goal of schoolcolors is to provide palettes for all possible NCAA
schools.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) by doing the following:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dermcnor/schoolcolors")
```

You can install the released version of schoolcolors from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("schoolcolors")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
Currently this is only the allcation of work for Cris and Myslef

``` r
library(schoolcolors)
## basic example code
```

## WIP

This is still a Work In Progress. You canâ€™t currently install from CRAN,
and the dev version has only a structure. There are many NCAA schools
and we would love any help that you can for populating the colors for
schools.

## initial Work Assignment

``` r
library(gh)

set.seed(42)
chunk_size <- 20
schools <- split(names(school_palettes), 
                 ceiling(seq_along(school_palettes) / chunk_size))
school_num <- split(seq_along(school_palettes), 
                    ceiling(seq_along(school_palettes) / chunk_size))
assignee <- sample(c("dermcnor", "cbenge509"), 
                   size = length(schools), 
                   replace = TRUE)
reference_url <- "https://github.com/dermcnor/schoolcolors/blob/07173925ceabcefdadefe25e675dd4a7362feab9/R/school_palettes.R#"

create_issue <- function(issue_num) {
  min_school <- min(school_num[[issue_num]])
  max_school <- max(school_num[[issue_num]])
  title <- paste0("Complete Schools ", min_school, " - ", max_school)
  body <- paste0("## The following schools need to be completed:\n", 
                 paste0("- [ ] ", 
                        schools[[issue_num]], 
                        collapse = "\n"),
                 paste0("\n\n", 
                        reference_url,
                        "L", min_school + 8, "-L", max_school + 8)
                 )
  
  gh("POST /repos/dermcnor/schoolcolors/issues", 
     title = title, 
     body = body,
     assignee = assignee[[issue_num]],
     labels = array("work task"))
  Sys.sleep(5)
}

posting <- lapply(seq_along(schools), create_issue)
```
