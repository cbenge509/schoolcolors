The goal of schoolcolors is to provide palettes for all possible NCAA schools. It is built very heavily upon the structure laid out in the [wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) package.

## WIP

This is still a Work In Progress.  You can't currently install from CRAN, and the dev version has only a structure.  There are many NCAA schools and we would love any help that you can for populating the colors for schools.

The method for populating a school is as follows:

1. Find School Colors:
    + Search for a school name and color palette.  This generally leads to a brand site or pdf for that school.
    + Only if there is no branding or web usage site, pull colors from [TruColor](http://www.trucolor.net/college-colors-nicknames/college-colors-nicknames-full-index/)
        + The current Institutional Colors should be used.
2. Populate Colors:
    + Find the line with the school_name and populate the vector with the Primary Colors.
    + If there are any additional colors, put them on a new vector in the list and order them according to secondary, tertiary, accent, supporting, etc.

### Example: College of William and Mary

- Initial code

    ```r
    college_of_william_and_mary = list(c())
    ```

- Populated Colors

    ```r
    college_of_william_and_mary = list(c("#115740", "#B9975B"),
                                       c("#F0B323", "#D0D3D4", "#00B388", "#CAB64B", 
                                         "#84344E", "#64CCC9", "#E56A54", "#789D4A", 
                                         "#789F90", "#5B6770", "#183028", "#00313C"))
    ```

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by doing the following:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("dermcnor/schoolcolors")
```

You can install the released version of schoolcolors from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("schoolcolors")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: Currently this is only the allocation of work for Cris and Myself

```{r example}
library(schoolcolors)
## basic example code
my_pal <- school_palette("college_of_william_and_mary")
as.character(my_pal)
my_pal
```



## Initial Work Assignment

``` r
library(gh)

set.seed(42)
chunk_size <- 20
schools <- split(names(school_palettes), 
                 ceiling(seq_along(school_palettes) / chunk_size))
school_num <- split(seq_along(school_palettes), 
                    ceiling(seq_along(school_palettes) / chunk_size))
assignee <- sample(c("dermcnor", "cbenge509"), 
                   size = length(schools), 
                   replace = TRUE)
reference_url <- "https://github.com/dermcnor/schoolcolors/blob/07173925ceabcefdadefe25e675dd4a7362feab9/R/school_palettes.R#"

create_issue <- function(issue_num) {
  min_school <- min(school_num[[issue_num]])
  max_school <- max(school_num[[issue_num]])
  title <- paste0("Complete Schools ", min_school, " - ", max_school)
  body <- paste0("## The following schools need to be completed:\n", 
                 paste0("- [ ] ", 
                        schools[[issue_num]], 
                        collapse = "\n"),
                 paste0("\n\n", 
                        reference_url,
                        "L", min_school + 8, "-L", max_school + 8)
                 )
  
  gh("POST /repos/dermcnor/schoolcolors/issues", 
     title = title, 
     body = body,
     assignee = assignee[[issue_num]],
     labels = array("work task"))
  Sys.sleep(5)
}

posting <- lapply(seq_along(schools), create_issue)
```
